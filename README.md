# minimal gcsl
This repository contains a minimal implementation of the approach proposed in

> *"Learning to Reach Goals via Iterated Supervised Learning"*, 
> Dibya Gosh et al., 2019

using PyTorch. In their approach, a goal-conditioned policy is trained by iteratively relabeling goals of past experiences according to actual (final) states reached.
